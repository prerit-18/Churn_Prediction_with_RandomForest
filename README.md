# Churn_Prediction_with_RandomForest  

This project implements a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict **customer churn** based on historical customer behavior data. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to stop using a service, enabling proactive retention strategies.

## 📌 Project Overview  
Customer churn is a critical issue for businesses, especially in highly competitive industries like telecom, banking, and subscription-based services. By predicting churn, companies can take preventive measures to improve customer retention.  

This project leverages **Random Forest**, an ensemble learning method, to classify customers into churners and non-churners.
